  <div class="feature"><p align="justify" class="style3">Was the Verdict of the Jury in the Colyer Hall Case Last Night. </p>
    <p align="justify" class="style3">It was late, yesterday afternoon, before all the evidence was heard in the Colyer Hall case, on trial in the circuit court. &nbsp; Several witnesses testified to the peaceable and otherwise excellent character that the defendant had always borne and the defendant himself made a sworn statement to the jury. &nbsp; &nbsp; He spoke in a straightforward manner, detailing all the circumstances of the killing of O'Ferrall , and showing that he had acted purely in self defense. </p>
    <p align="justify" class="style3">States Attorney Milton and Mr. C. M. Jones made a strong presentation for the state to the jury. &nbsp; The argument of Mr. W. A. Blount, for the prisoner, is said to have been one of the greatest efforts of his life. </p>
    <p align="justify" class="style3">Judge Maxwell's charge to the jury was a lucid explanation of the law bearing upon the case and was satisfactory to both sides. &nbsp; The jury retired about 9 o'clock and in half an hour returned a verdict of not guilty. </p>
    <p align="justify" class="style3">Many of Mr. Hall's relatives and friends were in court, anxiously awaiting the verdict, and when it was rendered they hastened to congratulate him. </p>
    <p align="justify" class="style3">The case of Frank Hamilton, colored, indicted for rape, is on trial, to-day. &nbsp; The morning session of the court was consumed in obtaining a jury. &nbsp; Hearing of the evidence in the case began at 8 p. m. &nbsp; The state is represented by State's Attorney Milton and the prisioner by Messrs C. B. Parkhill and C. M. Jones.</p>
